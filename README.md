I have a passion for everything data, extracting, transforming, loading, making vizualitions, you name it! When I'm not coding, you can usually find me hiking, running or traveling. Im a huge fan of traveling to places that are the most different from where I currently am whether it be culturally or climatically. The change makes life exciting! This attitude brough me to some incredible places but I now call Portland, OR home where im looking to further enhance and develop my coding skills!

I'm always looking for new and exciting projects to work on, and I'm excited to collaborate with other developers and creatives to bring those projects to life. If you have a project you'd like to work on, or just want to chat about coding, travel, or life in general, feel free to reach out to me at [your email address or social media handle]!
