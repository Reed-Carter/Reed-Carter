I have a passion for everything data, extracting, transforming, loading, making vizualitions, you name it! When I'm not coding, you can usually find me hiking, running or traveling. Im a huge fan of traveling to places that are the most different from where I currently am whether it be culturally or climatically. The change makes life exciting! This attitude brough me to some incredible places but I now call Portland, OR home where im looking to further enhance and develop my coding skills!
