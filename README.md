 I'm passionate about all things data. From extracting and transforming to loading and visualizing, you name it, I love it! When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring the great outdoors, whether it's hiking, running, or traveling to new and exciting destinations. I have a particular fascination with places that are vastly different from my current environment, both culturally and climatically. I find that the change adds an extra level of excitement to life!

This mindset has led me to some incredible places, but I now call Portland, OR home where I'm focused on enhancing and developing my coding skills. Check out some of the projects I've worked on below! If you have any questions or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me at reedandrew18@gmail.com or via linkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reed-carter/).
